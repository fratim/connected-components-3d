#TODO

1. Implement start_label into c++ code (so far shifted in python)
4. flush all print messages
5. try to copy neighbor_label dict over steps, so far have to create new in step2
6. get rid off neighbor_label_exist
7. Try to find global label set by only looking one direction
8. replace 2**30 by highest number
9. Do not reload neighbor_label_set_border_global on every iteration, but load it all at the end
10. Wall implementation
11. change c++ code to use a map

Questions:
1. Are we anyway interested in the diameter of dendroits?
2. Do we have code to find the distance from border field?
3. Are there biological aspects to consider, when choosing the visual center?
4. (Quite some implementation work - Should we run statistics on all of zebrafinch?)
