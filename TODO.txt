#TODO

1. Implement start_label into c++ code (so far shifted in python)
4. flush all print messages
5. try to copy neighbor_label dict over steps, so far have to create new in step2
8. replace 2**30 by highest number
11. change c++ code to use a map
12. Implement last block size also for x and y direction

Questions:
1. Are we anyway interested in the diameter of dendroits?
2. Do we have code to find the distance from border field?
3. Are there biological aspects to consider, when choosing the visual center?
4. (Quite some implementation work - Should we run statistics on all of zebrafinch?)
5. How to efficiently save dicts and sets?
6. Should I use a linear index for everything?
