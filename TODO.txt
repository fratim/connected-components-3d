#TODO slices_start:

1. Implement start_label into c++ code (so far shifted in python)
4. flush all print messages
5. try to copy neighbor_label dict over steps, so far have to create new in step2
6. get rid off neighbor_label_exist
7. Try to find global label set by only looking one direction
8. replace 2**30 by highest number
9. Do not reload neighbor_label_set_border_global on every iteration, but load it all at the end
10. Wall implementation
11. change c++ code to use a map

Questions:
1. Why does int64 take values higher than the specified max?
